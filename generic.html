								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p>
									The world is confronted with a myriad of challenges. Firstly comes with crisis and fear of depletion of natural resources--contributors to production of fuels. Additionally, emission of CO2 is an exigent issue since it is a greenhouse gas continuously heating the earth. Thirdly, disposal of garbage inside bins in neighborhoods. One particular case involves all the headaches mentioned above.  Not far from now, I began noticing that while my neighborhood's bin was far from being filled up, the truck would still get here and start working, when it was probably more in need for some other neighborhoods whose trashcans had been full, leaving residents no choice but to pile the garbage aside from trashcan, which produced terrible odor. Aside from the disturbing odor, another concern was about the fuel the truck burnt during the trip to our neighborhood's not-yet-full trashcans, which was totally unnecessary. It could pick up the garbage in our community next day so that, overall, it reduced a considerable amount of fuel consumption, cutting back on emission of CO2 into the air.

									After some observing and pondering, I came up with my solution to this problem: a system where the information about bin sites is monitored in real-time, an algorithm-based program takes the data as input and process it to form an optimal path based on 2 factors: Satisfaction and Total Distance, and, finally, display this route for truck drivers so they can immediately follow the path to start working.
